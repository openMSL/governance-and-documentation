<h1>GOVERNANCE RULES</h1>

<h3>ยง1 Purpose of ENVITED OpenMSL</h3>
The Open-Source Model & Simulation Library is anchored in the Data Pool of the ENVITED research cluster and is operated by the Automotive Solution Center for Simulation e.V. - ASCS. It is thus a further, independent instance in the data pool in addition to the data marketplace. The purpose of OpenMSL is to bundle open-source material in the area of simulation-driven product lifecycle processes for highly automated vehicles, to make it openly accessible, and to sustainably enable active and cooperative further development by stakeholders. The GitHub-based OpenMSL supports knowledge transfer and in addition the research and development of methods and processes in the mentioned area. This includes simulation models as well as data and software applications for the preparation, processing or evaluation of models as well as documents for knowledge transfer. The content of OpenMSL thus favors the processing of research questions and standardization approaches in the ENVITED research cluster and beyond. 

<h3>ยง2 Bodies of the ENVITED OpenMSL</h3>

The governing bodies of OpenMSL are the ENVITED Technical Steering Committee (TSC), the Data Cluster Maintainers (DCM), and the ASCS office.

<h5>2.1 ENVITED Technical Steering Committee (TSC)</h5>

The ENVITED Technical Steering Committee consists of 3-5 persons from among the ENVITED members, who are democratically elected by the annual ENVITED Cluster Meeting. The TSC passes resolutions by simple majority, which are to be documented by the ASCS office. The tasks of the TSC include the definition of the OpenMSL Governance Rules and the approval of data clusters. In addition, the TSC has the ability to pass resolutions to remove open-source material from OpenMSL or the public that has not been actively used or developed over an extended period of time.

<h5>2.2 Data Cluster Maintainers (DCMs)</h5>
Data Cluster Maintainers (DCMs) monitor the activities in the corresponding data cluster and define the specific governance rules. At least three DCMs from different ENVITED members are to be designated for each data cluster. The DCMs are democratically determined by the ENVITED members during the initialization phase and subsequently annually by the ENVITED Cluster Assembly. If a DCM resigns during his or her term of office, the DCMs of the affected data cluster can appoint a successor for the remaining term of office. The minimum number of DCMs in the data cluster must always be observed. DCMs pass resolutions by simple majority. If no clear decision can be made, e.g., due to a tie vote, the next higher decision-making bodies are called in (DCMs -> ENVITED TSC -> ENVITED Assembly -> ASCS Board -> ASCS General Meeting). An ENVITED member may provide more than one DCM in a data cluster, but the voting right remains the same. DCM meetings are to be documented publicly with details of the persons participating, the agenda and the contents of the discussion.
